# Fulcra App Template - React

A Next.js web application template for building on the Fulcra platform. This template includes:

- **Next.js** (App Router) with React 19
- **Auth0 authentication** via the device flow, with server-side API proxying
- **Tailwind CSS 4** with DaisyUI
- **Fulcra brand colors** and styling
- **ESLint** and **Prettier** configured
- **Vitest** for testing

> Prefer Svelte? There is a functionally identical [SvelteKit version](https://github.com/fulcradynamics/app-template-svelte).

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Configure environment variables:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then edit `.env` with your Auth0 credentials and Fulcra API endpoint.

3. Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at http://localhost:6173/

4. Build for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Deployment

Next.js runs anywhere Node.js does, with first-class support on Vercel.

**Environment variables** — wherever you deploy, set the same three vars from your `.env` in the platform's project settings:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH0_DOMAIN`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_FULCRA_API_ENDPOINT` (point this at a reachable API — not `localhost`)

> No extra Auth0 setup is required for deployed environments: the device-flow login uses no callback URLs, and logout uses no `returnTo`, so nothing needs adding to Auth0's allowlists.

### Local

```bash
npm run dev                  # dev server at http://localhost:6173
npm run build && npm run start   # run the production build locally
```

For a **self-hosted Node server or Docker**, run `npm run build` then `npm run start` (which runs `next start`). This serves the app on port 6173.

### Vercel

**Git integration (recommended):**

1. Import the repo at [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) — Next.js is auto-detected.
2. Add the three env vars under Project Settings → Environment Variables.
3. Every push deploys automatically.

**CLI:**

```bash
vercel login
vercel link                  # create/link the project
vercel env add NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH0_DOMAIN        # repeat for each var
vercel deploy                # preview deploy
vercel deploy --prod         # production deploy
```

## Customizing your app

- Set login branding in `lib/app-config.ts`: `appName`, `tagline`, `description`,
  `showSlots`, and optional `logoSrc` (for example `/your-logo.svg` in `public/`).
  Set `showSlots` to `false` to hide template placeholders. `LoginDeviceFlow` also
  accepts an optional partial `branding` prop; omitted fields use the config.
- Build your feature UI in `app/page.tsx`. It can use `useUser()` and call
  `user.logout()` directly, but should not initialize sessions or render login.
- Keep authentication plumbing separate from customization: `AuthGate` in the root
  layout, under `UserProvider`, waits for server session restoration before mounting
  either login or feature children. Leave the gate, login handlers, user/session
  implementation, and server authorization/API routes unchanged when branding the app.
  This client gate only delays client rendering/mounting: it does not authorize
  requests or stop server-component children from executing. Protected data fetched
  by server components requires server-side authentication and authorization,
  independently of the gate. Server routes must also enforce authorization.

## Authentication

This template includes Auth0 authentication out of the box, using the **Auth0 Device Authorization Flow** with server-side API proxying:

- **Device-flow login**: No callback URLs or Auth0 SPA SDK required; the flow is proxied through Route Handlers to avoid CORS
- **Access tokens**: Stored in HTTP-only cookies (more secure than localStorage)
- **API calls**: Proxied through Next.js Route Handlers, so calls to the Fulcra API are server-to-server
- **Full logout**: Revokes the refresh token and clears the Auth0 SSO session, not just local state
- **Portable**: No CORS issues and no domain allowlisting — works on any platform (Vercel, Netlify, self-hosted Node)

### How login works

1. User clicks **Sign In** → the app requests a device code from `/api/auth/device/code`
2. A popup opens Auth0's verification page; the user confirms the displayed code
3. The app polls `/api/auth/device/token` until Auth0 returns an access token
4. The token is stored in an HTTP-only cookie via `/api/auth/token`
5. Client requests hit `/api/*` Route Handlers, which use the cookie to call the Fulcra API server-to-server

### How logout works

**Sign Out** fully ends the session: it revokes the refresh token (`/api/auth/revoke`), clears the access-token cookie, wipes local state, and opens Auth0's `/v2/logout` to clear the SSO session so the next sign-in requires re-authentication.

The auth logic lives in `lib/user-context.tsx` and `lib/auth0-device-flow.ts`. This approach is more secure and doesn't require adding your domain to the Fulcra API CORS allowlist.

## Fulcra API Client

The template includes a `FulcraAPI` class (`lib/api-client.ts`) for organized access to the Fulcra REST API:

- **High-level methods** for common operations: `getUserInfo()`, `getUserPreferences()`, etc.
- **Low-level HTTP methods** for flexibility: `get()`, `post()`, `put()`, `delete()`
- **Designed for extension** — add new methods following the existing pattern

See the [Fulcra REST API documentation](https://docs.fulcradynamics.com/rest-api/) for available endpoints. When you need to call a new endpoint, add a method to `FulcraAPI` and use it from your Route Handlers.
